# Linkify

Linkify is a very simple URL shortener! It allows you to create a masked shorter version of your URL, share it with others via link or a QR Code!



How it's made
-

- React.JS
- React Router 
- Node.JS (Express)
- MongoDB
It uses a Express server hosted locally on my computer to handle shorten requests as well as shorten URL retrieval from a MongoDB database. It is tunneled using the NGROK client.
